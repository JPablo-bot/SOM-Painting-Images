# SOM-Painting-Images

SOM-Painting-Images is a project centered around the development of a Self-Organized Map (SOM) applied to extract color features from images. This aims to reconstruct a different image within this new color space. Despite advancements in feature extraction, it remains a challenge due to the robustness required in the employed algorithms. This project specifically focuses on extracting shades from RGB images and subsequently adjusting entirely different images to modify their color palette and generate new images.

## Overview

This project targets the extraction of color features using SOM, aiming to transform images by manipulating their color palettes. The primary focus is on manipulating the tonalities of RGB images to create entirely new visuals by adjusting their color spectrum. The goal is to provide a new perspective on color manipulation and image reconstruction within a specific color space defined by the SOM algorithm.

## Features

- **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**: Utilized for color feature extraction and image transformation.
- **Color Palette Adjustment**: Modifies the color palette of images to create new visuals.
- **RGB Image Processing**: Specifically focuses on extracting shades from RGB images.
- **New Image Generation**: Constructs new images by adjusting color features.
